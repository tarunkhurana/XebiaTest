##Installation

The front-end dev environment is done with nodeJS. Package.json contains the NPM dependencies. To install, cd into the directory and type in:

```
$ npm install
```

Client side dependencies are managed by bower and these should be installed if you want to run the client locally.

```
$ bower install
```

The development environment is powered by Gulp. If you have not already done so, you will need to install gulp (preferably globally).

```
$ sudo npm install -g gulp
```

Don't forget to type your password. If you can not execute with sudo, please contact your system administrator to allow you root admin access to your machine.
